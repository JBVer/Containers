## ğŸ’¡ About the project

- Containers is a C++ project focused on re-implementing core C++ standard containers (vector, map, stack and set) in adherence to the C++98 standard.

## Testing


```shell
# This command runs custom container tests and records the results in the 'custom' file.
g++ tests.cpp && ./a.out > custom && rm a.out

# The same tests from the standard C++ containers. Output stored in the 'standard' file
g++ -D STANDARD=1 tests.cpp && ./a.out > standard && rm a.out

# Displays the difference between the two outputs
diff custom standard
```
